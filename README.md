# IPEDS Colleges Database

## Purpose
I am interested in the topic of higher education, and interested in knowing more about different institutions in terms of their characteristics, the student-faculty ratio, and enrollment percentage, etc. For this project, I am looking to build a Django app to demonstrate data of more than 5000 higher educational institutions in the US. 

## Data set
This project is based on the 2016 survey data from IPEDS data center. The database for my Django app mainly includes the following data sets:

[Institution]:
this data set contains the information of each higher educational institution, including institution name, location (city and state), student-faculty ratio and percentage of admission.


[Graduation number by race]: 
this data set listed the number of graduation by race

[Academic domain]:
this data set listed the academic domains with the number of programs offered in relevant domain

[Academic Library]: 
this data set contain information about the academic libraries of institutions, including the type of collections and collection number in total.
